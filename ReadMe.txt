Hello recruiter person!

This is my current project I'm developing completely alone with GameMaker. Here are some sample stuff, like code I've written (in the objects).

This is a 2D platformer game set in a dystopic future where candy is heavily regulated. You play as an agent called Jane Hander, and it is your job to confiscate all the illegal candies!

This is the first full-length game I'm developing. I use a lot of my free time on it.

With this project I have learned to problem-solve and fix my code without using Google all the time. So, this project is making me a more independent and confident coder. I am also learning a lot about graphics and level design and game design. It has been an absolute joy to work on this.

I think the project properly shows that I have the capability to become an expert programmer.

Cheers!
